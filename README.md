🕹️ 2D Platformer Game – Enhanced Edition by Arous
This project is a customized fork of a clean 2D platformer template inspired by classic Mario-style gameplay. I expanded the base repo by implementing core mechanics, game logic, and UI systems to create a playable 3-level experience suitable for portfolio and recruitment review.

🚀 Key Features Added
🎮 Gameplay Mechanics
Tilemap-based level design using Unity’s Tilemap system for modular and scalable environments

Player movement with smooth controls, jump physics, and collision detection

Death zones and respawn logic for challenge and progression

Collectible keys to unlock level exits and trigger events

Enemy AI with patrol behavior and player interaction

🧩 Game Structure
Three fully playable levels with increasing difficulty and unique layouts

Scene transitions and level completion logic

Checkpoint system for player progress retention

🖥️ UI & UX
Main menu with start and quit options

Pause menu with resume and restart

Level HUD showing keys collected, lives, and current level

Game over and victory screens with replay options

🛠️ Technical Enhancements
Modular code structure for scalability and readability

Scriptable tile rules for automated environment generation

Custom animations for player and enemy states

Optimized asset usage from the original repo with added polish

🎯 Why This Matters
This project demonstrates my ability to:

Rapidly understand and extend existing codebases

Apply Unity fundamentals in a structured, production-like workflow

Balance technical implementation with gameplay experience

Build portfolio-ready projects that reflect real-world game dev scenarios
I will be uploading a WEBGL build soon
